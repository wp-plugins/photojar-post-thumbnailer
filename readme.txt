== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
Requires PHP5 and [PhotoJAR: Base](http://www.jarinteractive.com/code/photojar/).

1. Upload the `pj-post-thumbnail` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Adjust settings under the 'Settings -> PhotoJAR' menu in Wordpress.
4. Optional: Customize the pj-post-thumb.php template and place it in your theme's directory (Ex: 'wp-content/themes/Default').
5. Optional: Install a javascript viewer plugin (Ex: [Lightbox](http://stimuli.ca/lightbox/), [ThickBox](http://mezzomondo.nelblog.it/2007/05/28/thickbox3/), etc.) 
	if you want to make use of that feature.  PhotoJAR will handle the markup to enable this on your images.
